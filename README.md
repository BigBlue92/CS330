1. How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software is to first look and see what is provided already. Typically there will be something you're starting with, and familiarizing yourself with it is key. With openGL, there's a lot of code provided to you. Utilizing the code properly means understanding where key variables are, and where you can add or change things. It's also important to get an idea in your head of what the next step will be. A reasonable milestone is a good place to stop and test your software to make sure it does what you're thinking it will.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
Similarly to what  I mentioned before, I work toward a milestone in my program that could be a good stopping point to test it. It's good to work on one thing at a time and test those to make sure they work. Looking closely at the errors when things don't work is also very important. You have to be willing to search the errors online and find the answer from someone who had a similar issue. Often time this is difficult and you need to be careful about which search terms you use.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I'm hoping to eventually become a software developer that works on new features. Computer science is oretty much a requirement for me to be able to move into that role. Specifically computational graphics and visualizations have taught me how I can utilize different libraries together to accomplish a certain task. Developers need to be able to do this regardless if they are working with visual elements or not.
